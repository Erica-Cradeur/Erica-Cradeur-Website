        <p class="aboutmeparagraph"><span>Hello, I'm Erica Cradeur, an associate network engineer at Valmont Industries, Inc. My journey began as a network engineer intern during my college years at Creighton University, where I graduated with a double major in Computer Science & Informatics and Digital Development, along with a minor in Business Administration. While I initially focused on networking and cybersecurity, my true passion lies in web development, software engineering, front-end development, and UI/UX design. I aim to craft seamless and visually captivating digital experiences, drawing on my diverse skill set and business acumen to integrate cutting-edge technologies for optimal results.
          As a dedicated professional, my discipline, resilience, and problem-solving skills were honed during my time as a student-athlete, participating in cross country and track & field on scholarship. Now, in the tech industry, I'm committed to leveraging these qualities to achieve outstanding outcomes in every project I undertake. My goal is to connect with like-minded individuals who share my enthusiasm for technology and innovation, fostering collaboration and learning from one another.
          Thank you for visiting my website! If you're interested in exploring tech-related discussions or potential opportunities, feel free to reach out. Let's make a positive impact together in the world of web development and software engineering!</span></p>
